## Terraform Project Overview

This repository contains Terraform configuration files to manage and deploy infrastructure on various cloud providers. Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure using declarative configuration files.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Terraform**: Ensure you have Terraform installed. You can download it from the [official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- **Cloud Provider Account**: An account with the cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) for which you are deploying infrastructure.
- **Credentials**: Properly configured credentials for your cloud provider.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and deploy your infrastructure using Terraform:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Initialize the Terraform Configuration

```bash
terraform init
```

This command initializes your working directory containing Terraform configuration files. It downloads the necessary provider plugins and sets up the backend configuration.

### 3. Format and Validate the Configuration

```bash
terraform fmt
terraform validate
```

- **`terraform fmt`**: Formats the configuration files to a canonical format.
- **`terraform validate`**: Validates the configuration files for syntax and internal consistency.

### 4. Plan the Infrastructure Deployment

```bash
terraform plan
```

This command creates an execution plan, which shows what actions Terraform will take to create, update, or delete resources.

### 5. Apply the Configuration

```bash
terraform apply
```

This command applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration. You will be prompted to confirm before applying the changes.

### 6. Destroy the Infrastructure (Optional)

```bash
terraform destroy
```

This command destroys the infrastructure managed by the Terraform configuration. Use this to clean up resources when they are no longer needed.

├── variables.tf    # Variable definitions
├── outputs.tf      # Output definitions
├── provider.tf     # Provider configurations

│   ├── dev/

```

## Variables

Variables are defined in the `variables.tf` file. You can override these variables by creating a `terraform.tfvars` file or using the `-var` option in the `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands.

Example `terraform.tfvars`:

```plaintext
variable_name = "value"
```
## To create EC2 in AWS

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0f58b397bc5c1f2e8"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform"
    env = "production"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "terra-test-5628"

  tags = {
    Name        = "My bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}

## Outputs

Outputs are defined in the `outputs.tf` file and are used to display useful information after the infrastructure is created.

## Modules

Modules are located in the `modules/` directory. Each module should have its own directory containing its configuration files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`).

## Environments

Environment-specific configurations are located in the `environments/` directory. Each environment (e.g., `dev`, `prod`) should have its own directory with specific configuration files.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Open a pull request.
